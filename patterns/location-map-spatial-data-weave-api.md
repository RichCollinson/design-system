# Location map + Spatial data (Weave API) 

## What is it?
__Presents the customer options top provide a location OR specific asset location__  
The addition of spatial data ONLY changes the map UI and experience for the customer. 
Spatial data is loaded into the map and includes the coordinates of assets.
Each asset is represented with an icon. 
The design and background of this feature can be seen here.
Screen flows below show the map interaction
